The Pomodoro Technique is a highly effective time management method that enhances productivity by breaking work into focused 25-minute intervals (Pomodoros) followed by short 5-minute breaks. To help you make the most of this technique, we've designed the Pomodoro Timer â€“ a versatile time management tool tailored for efficient study and work sessions.

### Key Features

Our Pomodoro Timer comes packed with features designed to optimize your study and work routine:

1. **Work & Break Cycles:** Automatically cycles between 25 minutes of focused work and 5-minute breaks, mimicking the classic Pomodoro Technique.

2. **Clear Display:** The timer features a user-friendly display that indicates when a session starts, ends, and the remaining time. 

3. **End-of-Session Alarm:** Receive an audible alert when your 25-minute study session is complete, signaling the start of your 5-minute break.

4. **LED Time Indicator:** An intuitive LED system visually shows how much time you have left in your current Pomodoro, making it easy to stay on track.

5. **Total Daily Time:** Keeps a count of the total time you've spent studying or working throughout the day, providing valuable insights into your productivity.
